# mac-ca

Get MacOS System certificates into [Node.js][].

This is most of the time ok, but there are cases where you might for example want to use TLS in development with self signed certificates for which you have a root certificate in your local store. Eg: [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

This package is intended to fetch Root CAs from MacOS "SystemRootCertificates.keychain" and the user's keychain into [Node.js].

### Advantages

- No internet access is required at all
- MacOS store is updated automatically (in most modern environments)
- Manually installed Root certificates are used
- Enterpise trusted certificates (GPO etc.) are made available too

## Usage

Install with
```
npm install --save mac-ca
```

And then use it as follows:
```
require('mac-ca').addToGlobalAgent();
```

If called in other operative systems the method will just do nothing.

## API

After `require('mac-ca').addToGlobalAgent()` MacOs' Root CAs are found, deduplicated and installed to `https.globalAgent.options.ca` so they are automatically used for all requests with Node.js' https module and any higher-level library like axios, node-fetch or request.

For use in other places, these certificates are also available via `.get()` method.

```js
let ca = require('mac-ca')
let forge = require('node-forge')

for (let pem of ca.get())
  console.log(pem)
```

You can also specify the format as follows:

```js
ca.get({ format: ca.Format.der })
```


Available values for `format` are:

| Constant | Value | Meaning
|---|---:|---
der2.der | 0 | DER-format (binary, Node's [Buffer][])
|der2.pem | 1 | PEM-format (text, Base64-encoded)
|der2.txt| 2 | PEM-format plus some info as text
|der2.asn1| 3 | ASN.1-parsed certificate
| * | * | Certificate in `node-forge` format (RSA only)

Other options for `get`:
- `keychain` (defaults to `all`): it could be `all`, `current` or `SystemRootCertificates`.
- `unique` (defaults to `true`): exclude duplicated certificates found.
- `excludeBundled` (defaults to `true`): exclude certificates found in node.js's `tls.rootCertificates`.
